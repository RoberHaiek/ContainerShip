The flow is as following:
in the main the ship is initialized with the route (array of ports) - one by one in order
int  width, length, max height
instructions (each cell in this array represents a port, each cell contains an array of size 2, first cell is for containers to be loaded, second is for unloading)

then the main calls "ship.start", and the trip begins
start goes over all the ports and activates stowage
stowage calls optimize (which calls weightbalance)
optimize calculates the optimal instructions and returns a 2D array, each cell represents a container, each cell contains an array of size 5:
1- uniqueId of the container
2- is it to be loaded or unloaded?
where?
3- width
4- length
5- is it to be loaded from the temporary array, is it to be loaded to the temporary array?

Then after loading/unloading everything, go to the next port
