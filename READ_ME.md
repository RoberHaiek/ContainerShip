# **Container ship â€“ Design**  

## **Inclusion flow:**  
Simulator >> Stowage >> StowageTester >> Crane >> CraneTester >> Ship >> Container >> Port   

## **Classes, fields and data structures:**  
### **1-	Ship**  
    Constructor: Ship(int width, int length, int height)  
    Fields:  
        a- int weight of the ship  
        b- int shipWidth
        c- int shipLength
        d- int shipHeight
        e- map<string, int*> planMap - key = container unique id, value = [row,column,height] of container
        f- cellLinkedList planLinkedList - 2D array representation of the containers in the ship
          i- int size - how many containers are in the current cell [row][column]
          ii- int maxHeight - of current cell
          iii- node linkedList:
            1- Container
            2- next*
### **2-	Container**  
    Constructor: Container(int weight, Port destPort, string uniqueId)
    Fields:
        a.	Int weight
        b.	Port destPort
        c.	String uniqueId
### **3-	Port**  
    Constructor: Port(string portId)
    Fields:
        a.	String port (5 English letter code)
### **4- Crane**              // operates on a ship (loads/unloads containers)  
    Constructor: Crane(Ship ship)
        a- Ship ship - the ship on which the crane operates on
### **5- CraneTester**        // tests the laods/unloads validity  
### **6- Stowage**          // the algorithm   
   Constructor: Stowage(int i, Ship *ship, Port *route, Container *instructions, bool weightBalance function)
        a- int instNum   // the index of the current instruction to be returned in the end
        b- Ship ship
        c- Port* route
        e- int routeIndex
        f- string** currentInstructions // the returned instructions in the end:
                                           {container's unique id, "load/unload/reject", row, column, height}
        g- three deque<node*>'s  // to help the containers which are unloaded but need to be loaded back in the same port
### **7- StowageTester**  // tests if a container's destPort is in route or not  
### **8- Simulator** // runs the stowage  

## **Input/Output:**
input is directory path (root)
- in the root directory, there are travel directories, in each there are:  
1- ship plan
2- route
3- cargo file for each port in the route
4- output folder (container's unique id, "load/unload/reject", row, column, height)
5- expected_output folder (does not refer to the indexes of the containers, but to the content)
6- results.txt - result of algorithm as instruction number

## **The flow:**  
The Simulator receives info about the ship, initializes it, then receives the route of ports, and a list of instructions for each port, and runs the Stowage algorithm for each port with it's instructions.

The Stowage goes over all the containers in the ship and unloads what's relevant to the port, if a container is blocked, the algorithm puts it in a temporary dequeue, unlaods all above, then the container/s we need, then puts the containers that dont belong to the port back.Loads the containers to the ship, and returns a list of instructions.

The Simulator takes the instructions and runs them on an empty ship using the crane and validates that they're legal.

## **Notes**  
Due to the lack of time and the size of the project we were unfortunately unable to fulfill the whole requirements.
The Simulator does not receive an algorithm as an input - to run your algorithm, replace the Stowage.cpp file with your own Stowage.cpp file and the API above.
When loading a container using the crane, it does not load it in the height you want but places it on top.
The Simulator does gives the Stowage a weightBalance function.
